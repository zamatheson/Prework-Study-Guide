# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a study guide for bootcamp students who are currently completing their prework assignments. This guide assists students by allowing notes to be taken and stored in one place so students always have access to the basics of website development. By creating this webpage, I learned the cruicial fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript so when I start my bootcamp I will already be familiarized with some information.

Students can choose a topic and learn their basics from the prewritten notes. By opening the DevTools console, students will be able to see JavaScript running.
